# Jenkins CI/CD: What's Working

## Current Status (as of March 4, 2025)

This document tracks the progress of our Jenkins CI/CD pipeline implementation for the Fireworks Sales application.

## Pipeline Components

```

## What's Working

1. ✅ Agent Configuration:
   - Successfully using the `docker-agent-alpine` label
   - Node context is properly set up

2. ✅ Docker Registry Authentication:
   - Docker credentials (`DOCKER_REGISTRY_CREDENTIALS`) have been set up correctly
   - Jenkins can now authenticate with Docker Hub

3. ⚙️ Build Process:
   - Pipeline correctly checks out code from Git repository 
   - Node.js and pnpm setup stages are defined

## Known Issues

1. ❌ NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:
   - Missing or improperly configured credential
   - Pipeline is failing with "ERROR: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL"

2. ❌ Post-build Cleanup:
   - The `cleanWs` step in the post section is failing
   - Error: "Required context class hudson.FilePath is missing"
   - This is likely due to the step not being within a node context

3. ❌ Deploy Scripts:
   - `deploy-staging.js` and `deploy-prod.js` are placeholder files
   - Need to implement proper Docker-based deployment for staging and production

## Next Steps

1. Add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` credential to Jenkins:
   - Create a secret text credential with the API URL
   - Set the ID to "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL"

2. Update the Jenkinsfile post section:
   - Ensure the cleanWs step is within a proper node context
   - Fix the post-build actions to prevent the "hudson.FilePath is missing" error

3. Complete deployment scripts:
   - Implement `deploy-staging.js` based on the pattern in `deploy-dev.js`
   - Implement `deploy-prod.js` with appropriate production deployment steps

4. Testing and verification:
   - Push updated changes to the repository
   - Monitor Jenkins build for successful completion
